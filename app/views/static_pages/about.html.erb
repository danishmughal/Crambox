    Crambox is a new type of social tool: rather than connecting you with people you already know or have met, it connects you with completely new students on campus. It helps you <strong>discover</strong> new people. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Ever wished you could find a group of people to study with for a particularly challenging class? Crambox can instantly find people and make you a study group. Furthermore, we help match you up with tutors, and simply people in your classes that you may want to talk to.

    <p>“I’m a freshman at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I’m from a small Chicago suburb called Bartlett and I went to Bartlett High School. My hobbies include watching cheesy sci-Fi films, playing airsoft, eating new foods, cycling, building things, rock climbing, driving, and running. I aspire to be a psychiatrist. I came up with the idea of Crambox while thinking of a major shortcoming of existing social networking sites that connect people with friends and acquaintances; they don’t allow  people to expand their existing networks. Crambox provides a tool that does do that.”

    <p>I'm also a freshman at UIUC. I'm from Fremont, California, a small suburb on the East Bay of San Francisco's Bay Area. Other than that I've also studied abroad for two years in Karachi. I've been playing around with technology for as long as I can remember, and it's the one of the few things I am truly passionate about. I've been coding since the age of 11, and when I discovered web development a bitlater, I was simply hooked. <br />
    After all this time working on it's development, I know that Crambox will change the world of college students across the country.
